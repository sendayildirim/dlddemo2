21,21,"Emirates Book Valuation Standards (EBVS) INTRODuCTION 221 4	MEASURING	SPACES according to the Emirates Book Valuation Standards (EBVS) and International Property Measurement Standards (IPMS). The Emirates Book Valuation Standards places great emphasis on appropriate and accurate measurement of spaces, as measuring spaces is an essential component of ensuring high accuracy of assessment. In this context, this book recommends the use of international standards for measuring real estate by the Valuer to the maximum extent possible. 1 4 10 The Dubai Land Department and the Real Estate Regulatory Agency fully support international standards for real estate measurement. 1 4 20 Terms such as Built Up Area (BUA) and Gross Floor Area (GFA) are common terms used in Dubai, where the term Built Up Area refers to the total built area of a specific building, and this term is usually used by contractors and developers to calculate the construction cost . The Gross Floor Area is the total area fit for use in a building, and this term is usually used by planning authorities to monitor and control the amount of space being built. Typically, the following approximate estimate is correct in Dubai: Gross Floor Area + Covered Area = Built Up Area. Which means that the Built Up Area is usually larger than the Gross Floor Area. It is expected from Valuers to use historical figures for Built Up Area or Floor Area while they carry out appraisal works. 1 4 30 There is no internationally recognized definition of the terms Built Up Area and Gross Floor Area, for this reason this book imposes the use of international standards for measuring real estate on all Valuers, in order to enhance transparency and to allow comparison of appraisals with other financial reports. 1 4 40 During the implementation of the valuation work and upon the coincidence of a designated area, it shall always refer this to the original standard according to which this area was calculated in addition to converting to the formulation of the International Property Measurement Standards of related real estate, and this is called a double report and valuers must use this as reasonably as possible."
22,22,"Emirates Book Valuation Standards (EBVS) INTRODuCTION 231 4 50 A dual report is important because it indicates to the valuer, the customer and anyone reading the report any elements that have been included or excluded from the areas, which will have a direct impact on the value of the property. 1 4 60 International Property Measurement Standards should be used as a common denominator to ensure the consistency of the standards for measuring the different area in use. 1 4 70 The gross floor area of a building (whether it is an administrative building, multi story building, villa, contiguous houses/townhouse, units, or industrial buildings) represents the gross floor areas of a multi story building, villa, townhouse, units, or industrial buildings. The floor areas can be classified into the area of the apartments, the balcony area and the common areas. This area is included in the site plans and must be calculated using International Property Measurement Standards www.ipmsc.org 1 4 80 The following are the approved standards for measuring and calculating the floor area for valuation purposes: 1. Apartments area (Area A) = IPMS Standard 3A   0.5 x component B1 (exterior walls) Comment This equation is used to convert the Dubai Land Department standard used with freehold real estate into International Property Measurement Standards. 2. The area of the balconies (Area B) = the area of the balconies + 0.5 x component B1 (exterior walls) Comment This equation is used to convert the Dubai Land Department’s standard for property used with freehold real estate to International Property Measurement Standards. 3. The area in the title deed issued by Dubai Land Department =A + B = IPMS 3A standard + balconies area. Please note that these equations only apply to title deeds issued by the Dubai Land Department in respect of spaces and areas of freehold real estate in Dubai."

EBVS 104.30.2 Market rent can be used as a basis for value when valuing a lease or a share arising from a leasing contract. In such cases, it is necessary to consider the rent value stipulated in the contract; if it was different, then the market rent. 2.

EBVS 104.40.1 Fair Value is the estimated price for the transfer of an asset or liability between identified knowledgeable and willing parties that reflects the respective interests of those parties. 2. EBVS 104.50.1 Investment Value refers to the asset value for an identified or potential owner in terms of individual investment or operational goals. 2. EBVS 104.60.2 A valuer must disclose which premise of value is assumed.2. EBVS 104.40.2 Fair Value requires valuing a fair price between identified parties taking into consideration gains and losses of each party in the transaction. On the other hand, “market value” requires ignoring any gains or losses that are unavailable for market participants to be incurred in general. 2. EBVS 104.50.2 Investment Value is the basis value allocated to an entity. Although the asset value for the owner might be the same amount of money that can be achieved by selling to another party, such a basis value reflects the gains the entity will make from keeping the asset. Consequently, this does not include the suggested exchange. Investment value reflects the entity’s financial conditions and purposes for which a valuation is conducted, and it is often used to measure the investment performance. 2. EBVS 104.60.1 Liquidation Value is the amount that would be realized when an asset or group of assets are sold on a piecemeal basis. Liquidation Value should take into account the costs of getting the assets into saleable condition as well as those of the disposal activity. Liquidation Value can be determined under two different premises of value: A An orderly transaction with a typical marketing period. B A forced transaction with a shortened marketing period."

EBVS 105.20.2 The key steps in the Comparable Transactions Method, as outlined in IVS 105, para 30 6, are as follows: A identify the units of comparison that are used by participants in the relevant market. B identify the relevant comparable transactions and calculate the key valuation metrics for those transactions. C perform a consistent comparative analysis of qualitative and quantitative similarities and differences between the comparable assets and the subject asset. D make necessary adjustments, if any, to the valuation metrics to reflect differences between the subject asset and the comparable assets (see para 30.12(d)). E apply the adjusted valuation metrics to the subject asset. F if multiple valuation metrics were used, reconcile the indications of value. 2.

In addition, the party concerned shall provide information about the leasing contract, terms of contract, and assets specifications. 2. Ensure that the information is being validated and acquired from transactions that reflect the market condition in order for the prices to represent an unusual incentive for the seller and the buyer gets excluded, such as deals in which a buyer pays a certain increase in order to acquire a specific asset, or deals that are made through sales between parties in unusual circumstances (ex. kinship, mandatory nature due to mortgage/ dispossession, or others). 3. Perform comparative analysis of asset sales using certain comparable metrics such as property type, selling date, land area, building area, market condition, location, price per square meter, and construction cost per square meter; and then adjust the comparison metrics to reflect the difference between the subject asset and the comparable asset. 4. Perform a comparison of comparable assets in terms of subject asset marketability using comparison metrics and adjusting the price of each metric to be sold according to valuation subject asset. 5.

EBVS 105.30.2 As outlined in IVS, “Although there are many ways to implement the income approach, all methods under the income approach are effectively based on discounting future amounts of cash flow to present value. They are all variations of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method and the concepts below apply in part or in full to all income approach methods”."
41,41,"Emirates Book Valuation Standards (EBVS) INTRODuCTION 422. EBVS 105.30.3 As outlined in IVS 105, para 50.4, the key steps in the DCF method are: A choose the most appropriate type of cash flow for the nature of the subject asset and the assignment (i.e. gross or net, pre tax or post tax, total cash flows or cash flows to equity, real or nominal, etc.). B determine the most appropriate explicit period, if any, over which the cash flow will be forecast. C prepare cash flow forecasts for that period. D determine whether a terminal value is appropriate for the subject asset at the end of the explicit forecast period, if any, and then determine the appropriate terminal value for the nature of the asset. E determine the appropriate discount rate. F apply the discount rate to the forecasted future cash flow, including the terminal value, if any. 2. EBVS 105.30.4 In order to implement the Discounted Cash Flow Method in Dubai, a valuer shall carry out the additional following procedures: 1. Collect relevant data to manage accounts such as annual income, asset utilization rate, leasing percentage, operation cost, and share percentage for a given number of years. 2. Calculate actual income by subtracting vacancy percentage (vacancy percentage equals 100%   leasing percentage) of the asset annual gross income. Such a calculation shall be repeated based on the number of years. 3. Calculate net operating income by subtracting operating cost of actual income. 4.

The approach provides an indication of value by calculating the current replacement or reproduction cost of an asset and making deductions for physical deterioration and all other relevant forms of obsolescence”."
42,42,"Emirates Book Valuation Standards (EBVS) INTRODuCTION 432.EBVS 105.40.3 The key steps in the Cost Approach, as outlined in IVS 105, paras 70 2 to 70 7, are as follows: A calculate all of the costs that would be incurred by a typical market participant seeking to create or obtain an asset providing equivalent utility or be an exact replica of the subject asset. B determine whether there is any deprecation related to physical, functional and external obsolescence associated with the subject asset, and C deduct total deprecation from the total costs to arrive at a value for the subject asset”. 2.EBVS 105.40.4 In order to implement the Cost Approach in Dubai, a valuer should carry out the following procedures: 1. Calculate the construction cost per square meter of similar buildings (cost includes, for example, land value, infrastructure cost, design fees, financing cost, etc.). 2. Calculate the building’s total area using the International Property Measurement Standards. Determine the life expectancy of the buildings (recommended: 35 years) in conjunction with determining the depreciation percentage (approx. 3% per year). 3. Determine the construction year of the building in order to identify the gross depreciation (approx. 3% per year). 4. Determine the land price per square meter in order to know the land value through multiplying the total land area by the price per square meter. 5. Conclude the building construction value through multiplying the total land area by the construction cost per square meter. 6. Conclude the building value after depreciation, and then it is multiplied by the construction cost per square meter. 7. Conclude the building value after depreciation. 8. In order to find the asset value though the Cost Approach, the land value is added to the building value."

EBVS 105 50 PROFIT METHOD EBVS 105.50.1 As ouAs outlined in the “IVS 105 Valuation Approaches and Methods”, para 50.6: “For some real property shares, the income generating ability of the property is closely tied to a particular use or business/trading activity (for example, hotels, golf courses, etc.). Where a building is suitable for only a particular type of trading activity, the income is often related to the actual or potential cash flows that would accrue to the owner of that building from the trading activity. The use of a property’s trading potential to indicate its value is often referred to as the “profits method”. 2. EBVS 105.50.2 It should be mentioned that, “When the income used in the income approach represents cash flow from a business/trading activity (rather than cash flow related to rent, maintenance and other real property specific costs), the valuer should also comply as appropriate with the requirements of IVS 200 Business and Business Interests and, where applicable, IVS 210 Intangible Assets. A valuer should comply with the requirements of “Valuation Approaches and Methods of IVS 105” and para 50 on Income Approach Methods. “(IVS 105, Valuation Approaches and Methods, 50.7). 2. EBVS 105.50.3 In order to implement the Profit Method in Dubai, a valuer should carry out the following additional procedures: 1. Consider the expected profit rather than the actual profit. 2. Seek guidance from the relevant body in terms of asset income and expense registered in the accounting records. Usually, the last three years of the relevant accounting standards are taken into consideration, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards in order to determine the income trend. Therefore, actual calculations should be considered as a directional guide in terms of expense and return that can be attained. 3. Subtract vacancy and return collection risks as a percentage of total revenue in order to calculate gross income. 4. Subtract operating expenses, which include the following for example: A Fixed expenses, real property fees (direct or indirect). B Variable expenses, maintenance and administrative cost etc. C Savings or replacement cost (for example add another story for the car park), which can be estimated as percentage of the total revenue in order to calculate gross income. 5.

As for the types of real estate rights that the two groups may possess or benefit from, they are generally the original real rights and the accessory real rights. The right to property (free property) is considered one of the most important real rights, as it is one of the broadest in scope, because it gives its owner full authority over the property, as he can dispose of the property in kind, benefit, and exploitation. The legislator added to these rights, another right, which is the right of long term rent for a period not exceeding (99) years, and long term rent known in English law, and this right enables the tenant to use the property for a period not exceeding (99) years but does not give him the right to own the property Or the land on it."
