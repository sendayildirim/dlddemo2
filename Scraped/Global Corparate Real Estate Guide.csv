Structures used to invest in real estate include joint stock companies, limited liability companies, a Jebel Ali Free Zone company, a Dubai Multi Commodities Centre company, a company incorporated in the ADGM or a company incorporated in the DIFC. How	are	real	estate	transactions	usually	funded?

Who	usually	produces	the	documentation	in	real	estate	transactions?	A transaction will usually begin when heads of terms or a memorandum of understanding is produced by the broker on behalf of the seller and the buyer.

Once the sellerâs lawyer has received the heads of terms or memorandum of understanding, they will prepare the initial draft of the sale and purchase agreement. In the meantime, the buyerâs lawyer will carry out due diligence, the results of which will steer the negotiations on the sale and purchase agreement received from the seller. Dubai To effect registration in Dubai, a standard Form F agreement produced by the Dubai Land Department will be entered into by the seller, buyer and broker and lodged with the Dubai Land Department.

In both Abu Dhabi and Dubai, leases between private landlords and tenants are freely negotiable. Is	there	a	maximum	term	for	leases?	Can	these	be	extended?	A usufruct right ends after 50 years, unless another period is specified in the deed establishing the right. The maximum term for a musataha right is 50 years with a right to extend for a further 50 years. The maximum term for a lease is 99 years. Short term leases must not exceed 10 years (or four years in Abu Dhabi) and can be renewed on expiry, if the new lease does not exceed 10 years (or four years). What	are	the	usual	lease	terms?	The duration of the term is a matter for commercial negotiation. Tenants will usually ask for a longer term where the tenant has to incur substantial expenses in the fitting out and decoration of the premises concerned. Are	there	instances	where	tenants	may	demand	an	extension	of	the	lease?	In Dubai, the tenant has an automatic right to renew the lease. However, the landlord can object to the renewal of a lease and request the eviction of the tenant on expiry of the lease in the following circumstances: â¢ Urban development in the emirate mandated the demolition of the property â¢ Renovation or carrying out overall maintenance â¢ Demolition of the property and rebuilding thereof â¢ Recovery of the property for their own private use On	what	grounds	may	a	lease	be	terminated?	A lease will usually terminate under any of the following circumstances: â¢ Either the landlord or the tenant fundamentally breaches the lease. â¢ The tenant sublets without the landlordâs permission. â¢ The tenant fails to pay rent within the stipulated period. Must	rents	be	paid	in	local	currency?	Rent is often specified in Emirati dirhams or US dollars. Unless specified otherwise in the lease, the tenant has to pay rent in Emirati dirhams.

Rent is usually paid quarterly by way of postdated cheques or via electronic transfer. How	is	rent	reviewed?	Are	there	limits	to	the	increase	in	rent?	Leases often contain a rent review clause. Rent review will generally be carried out at contractually specified intervals during the term or toward the end of the term for determining the rent for the renewed term in cases where the tenant exercises its option to renew. The general purpose of a rent review clause is to ascertain the level of market rent. A rent review clause will usually provide for the new rent to be agreed between the "
10,10," Bu dokÃ¼manda HASSAS bilgi bulunmamaktadÄ±r. / This document does not contain SENSITIVE informaAon. parties, and if the parties fail to reach an agreement, the rent will be determined by an independent valuer (a valuation surveyor, usually) as expert. Dubai In Dubai, Decree No. (43) of 2013 Determining Rent Increase for Real Property in the Emirate of Dubai provides that when reviewing real property lease contracts, the maximum percentage of rent increase will be as follows: â¢ No rent increase where the rent of the property unit is up to 10% less than the average rental value of similar units â¢ 5% of the rent of the property unit, where the rent is 11% to 20% less than the average rental value of similar units â¢ 10% of the rent of the property unit, where the rent is 21% to 30% less than the average rental of similar units â¢ 15% of the rent of the property unit, where the rent is 31% to 40% less than the average rental value of similar units â¢ 20% of the rent of the property unit, where the rent is more than 40% less than the average rental value of similar units Abu	Dhabi Abu Dhabi Law No. (20) of 2006 as amended, entitles the landlord to increase the rent by a maximum rate of 5% of the existing rate of the rental amount.

May	a	tenant	sublet	the	leased	premises?	A leasehold is an interest in land that is freely alienable. The most typical types of transactions relating to a leasehold interest are assignment of the interest and subletting. Practically speaking, a lease will almost invariably restrict the tenantâs freedom to deal with the leasehold interest, although the extent of such restriction varies between agreements. What	happens	in	the	event	of	destruction	of	the	leased	premises?	Usually, a lease will contain an abatement of rent clause, which provides that the rent or a fair proportion thereof will be suspended from the occurrence of damage or destruction or order until the premises or the building will again be rendered fit for occupation or accessible, or until the demolition order or closing order is lifted (as the case may be). If the premises or the building have not been reinstated within a predetermined period, either party has the right to terminate the lease. Who	is	usually	responsible	for	insuring	the	leased	premises?	There is usually an express provision in a lease that specifies the landlordâs obligation to insure the structure of the exterior of the premises and the common areas and the tenantâs obligations to insure the nonstructural interiors of the leased premises and third party liabilities. Will	the	lease	survive	if	the	owner	sells	the	leased	premises?	A lease will generally survive a subsequent sale of the leased premises and the terms and conditions of the lease will typically be transferred to the new owner. Will	the	lease	survive	if	the	leased	premises	are	foreclosed?	An existing lease is generally binding on the mortgagee and any sale by the mortgagee will be subject to that lease. Where a lease is created after a sale, the mortgage deed will require the mortgagor to obtain the mortgageeâs consent before creating the lease. If consent is obtained, then the lease will not be challenged. Planning and Environmental Issues "
