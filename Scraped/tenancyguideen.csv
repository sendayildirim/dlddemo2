Contents of the Index For the purpose of creating the Index, all types of properties and rental units in the various regions of the Emirate of Dubai were listed. An electronic data record was created for each area. The record includes types of units and their uses, the minimum and maximum rent values, and the average rent payment. The Index is divided into three main areas by region, namely: Deira, Dubai, and freehold areas. Property uses are determent as follows: residential, commercial and industrial.
