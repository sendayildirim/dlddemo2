In all events, the Owner may not be discharged from his liability to pay the Service Charges and Usage Charges if the tenant fails to pay the same as prescribed under this Law.Disposition of Common Parts and Common Facilities Article (17) a. In all events, Common Parts may neither be converted into private property; nor subdivided; nor disposed of in whole or in part, independently from the Units to which they pertain, without first obtaining the approval of the DLD and the Competent Authority. This applies even if the building to which the Common Parts belong is under construction. The Director General shall issue a resolution prescribing the rules for using the proceeds generated from such a conversion, subdivision, or disposition. b. Unless the relevant prior approvals of the DLD and the Competent Authority are obtained, it is prohibited to dispose of Common Facilities in any manner whatsoever; or utilise, alter, redesign, or shut down these facilities in a manner that restricts their use by Owners.

In this case, the Jointly Owned Real Property shall have a single Owners Committee constituted of members appointed by RERA as prescribed under this Law. c. The Developer may outsource all or any of his duties, and delegate all or any of his responsibilities, under sub paragraph (a)(1) of this Article to a Management Company in return for the fees, and subject to the conditions, agreed upon by both parties. This agreement must be approved by RERA. d. In case of absence of a Developer in a project that falls in Category 1 or Category 2, as stated in paragraph (a) of this Article, a Management Company shall be appointed by RERA. Management of Common Facilities Article (19) The Master Developer of a Master Project shall undertake the management and maintenance of the Common Facilities in that project. The Master Developer must outsource such management and maintenance to a Management Company pursuant to a written agreement approved in advance by RERA. Building Management Regulations Article (20) a. A Developer shall issue the Building Management Regulations of the Major Projects and Hotel Projects managed by that Developer. Building Management Regulations must be approved by RERA before making any legal disposition in respect of the Units comprising the Jointly Owned Real Property in the Major Project or Hotel Project in accordance with the provisions of this Law, the resolutions issued in pursuance hereof, and the Master Community Declaration. b. RERA shall issue the Building Management Regulations of Jointly Owned Real Property other than the projects referred to in paragraph (a) of this Article, provided that such Jointly Owned Real Property has no Building Management Regulation. In this regard, RERA may engage any specialised company to assist it in drafting the Building Management Regulation.c. If a part of the Jointly Owned Real Property is developed in phases, the Building Management Regulation for that developed part must be issued. Master Community Declarations Article (21) The Master Developer of a Master Project shall issue the Master Community Declaration of that project before making any legal disposition in respect of the land, buildings, or Units of the project. The Master Community Declaration must be approved by RERA. Any amendment to that Master Community Declaration, affecting in any way the rights of purchasers, may not be made without first obtaining the relevant approval of RERA. Owners Committees Article (22) a. The Owners Committee of a Real Property project that falls in Category 1 or Category 3, as stated in paragraph (a) of Article (18) of this Law, shall be constituted of a maximum of nine (9) members appointed by RERA, including the committee chairman and vice chairman. b. An Owners Committee shall be constituted upon the registration of at least ten percent (10%) of the total Units of the Jointly Owned Real Property on the Real Property Register in the names of their respective Owners. c. A member of an Owners Committee must: 1. be of full legal capacity; 2. be an Owner residing in the Jointly Owned Real Property; 3. be of good character and repute; 4. pay the Service Charges and Usage Charges; and 5. attend, and actively participate in, the meetings of the Owners Committee. d. A Developer may be a member of the Owners Committee only if he owns unsold Units in the Jointly Owned Real Property. e. An Owners Committee shall elect from amongst its members the chairman of that committee, who shall represent it before the Management Entity and RERA. f. The provisions and conditions stipulated in this Law, the resolutions issued in pursuance hereof, and the Statute shall apply to Owners Committees. g. Subject to the provisions of this Law, RERA shall issue Statutes. h. The membership of an Owner in the Owners Committee shall be terminated if he ceases to meet any of the membership requirements stipulated in paragraph (c) of this Article, in which case RERA shall appoint a replacement member who meets these requirements."
12,12,"23 22i. RERA may, at any time, reconstitute an Owners Committee, provided that the new members meet the Owners Committee membership requirements. Meetings of Owners Committees Article (23) a. An Owners Committee shall be regularly convened every three (3) months, i.e. four (4) times a year; and its first meeting shall be convened within thirty (30) days from the date of its constitution. Meetings of the Owners Committee shall be valid if attended by the majority of its members, provided that its chairman or vice chairman is in attendance. b. Where necessary, the Owners Committee may convene an extraordinary meeting, provided that it notifies RERA in advance of the date and time of this meeting and the reasons for convening the same. c. When voting on the resolutions and recommendations of the Owners Committee, each of its members shall have one (1) vote, whether he owns one (1) Unit or multiple Units in the Jointly Owned Real Property.
